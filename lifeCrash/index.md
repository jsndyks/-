## LIFE CRASH

When I was thinking about what has happened to me over the last few months, one term seemed to describe it pretty well: ‘**Life Crash**’.

I _Googled_ it, to see whether anybody else had ever had one, and not much came up ... other than [a wonderful  cartoon](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceq4sHqOAvQ/?img_index=1) by [Henry Jones](https://henryjonesstudio.com/). 
His sequence of sketches captures (celebrates?) [an incident caught on video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceq4sHqOAvQ/?img_index=4) outside the [MACBA](https://www.macba.cat/en), that involves a juddering <span class="crash">&laquo;<span class="caps"><u>CRASH</u></span>&raquo;</span>.
The drawings are part of a collection that observes the everyday as it happens around the [Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art](https://www.macba.cat/en),
hence: &nbsp;&nbsp;_[MACBA <u>Life</u>](https://macbalife.com/)_ <span class="crash">&laquo;<span class="caps">CRASH</span>&raquo;</span>.

That’s how _Life_ and _Crash_ find themselves together in a _Google_ search - unusually as it turns out - and how I found this imagery that I am clinging onto, sharing here, and hanging on the wall at home, as my head continues to spin. The term seemed to describe how I felt very effectively, but the incident and the way [Henry Jones](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nexkad/take-a-dive-into-henry-jones-satirical-skate-art) depicted the <span class="crash">&laquo;<span class="caps">CRASH</span>&raquo;</span> so tellingly, resonated particularly strongly with me.<br/>Yep, that was me. I knew how that felt.<br/>Life Crash.
<!-- I have had a  ‘**Life Crash**’. -->

Somehow the cartoon captures much of what I am feeling surprisingly effectively. It is _joyful_, _sudden_, _scary_, _painful_, _funny_, _surprising_, _concerning_, _uncertain_, _everyday_, _extraordinary_, _unfinished_. There I was, cruising along, decent pace, smooth surface, enjoying life without too much friction, pulling a few tricks, not working too hard but still surprising a few people (myself mainly). I was loving the view (the family, the bike, the kayak, the garden, even the cats) and the feeling of the breeze rushing by, with good balance - slight adjustments en route, and thinking I knew how to ride this life thing pretty well when …<br/><span class="crash">&laquo;<span class="caps">CRASH</span>&raquo;</span>.
<br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:0em">I’m on my back, looking at the skies, seeing stars and wondering whether or not I can pick myself up and keep going.</em><br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:2em">My head hurts.</em><br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:4em">Everything hurts.</em><br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:6em">Everything has stopped.</em><br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:8em">What the hell was that?</em><br/><em class="indent" style="padding-left:10em">What was I doing?</em>

I like the _sigh_, the sharp intake of breath, that you can hear on [the video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceq4sHqOAvQ/?img_index=4). I know that sound too.

My personal sturdily foundationed litter bin is _skin cancer_. Early in the summer I noticed a mark on the back of my leg that I didn’t remember seeing before. My kayaking and swimming and cycling and beach pilgrimages were interrupted by various checks, inspections, photos, consultations and ultimately minor surgery through July and August. I got a call from the Dermatology unit while I was paddling on the River Fowey with Emma: a coffee from _[Brown Sugar](https://www.brownsugarfowey.com/)_ and a waterproof bag full of freshly baked goodies from the _[Quay Bakery](https://quaybakery.co.uk/)_ on board. We'd followed kingfishers and had a dip in Pont Creek on our way across the channel. I had one final swim in the deep cold brackish out by the blockhouse, one final jump off the rocks, before being hoiked home early and dragging the family back to Leicester for the clinic. I sort-of knew where I was.

I know my skin well. I have always been fussy about my moles and blemishes as my Mum, _Phyl_, had a malignant melanoma removed in the 70s when she was in her early 30s. I was about 10 then: blond bowl haircut, baggy jeans, scruffy trainers, M&S T-shirt, home-knitted jumper (for goal posts, thanks Nana). Despite her amazing and inspiring recovery, I have always been hyper vigilant and hyper scared of cancer as:

* **Mum** had a chunk of her thigh removed and a successful skin graft that played a pretty big part in my childhood; and after that ...
* **I** spent many nights in hospital aged about 11 or 12 on a ward with children who were receiving treatment. I had an undiagnosed muscle wasting disease and was under long-term care and observation. The kids on the ward at Bristol Children’s Hospital were quite lively and unnervingly hirsute by day, sporting thickly weaved wigs. They raced around the ward more than I did - no muscles you see. But my memories of the nights are strong and stay with me. The kids were bald and restless, wailing and needing medical staff as the lights on their bedside machines flashed and unleashed urgent and unrelenting beeps as they revealed bedside hairpieces hanging in the semi-dark. It sounded awful. It looked scary. I remember the desperation of the doctors in the night. I wasn’t sure whether these scalped kids were being killed or being kept alive, whether they were dying or not, whether I was supposed to be able to see and hear. What to do? I didn’t sleep much. I had lots of blood taken over the weeks, and doctors standing over me discussing cancer, leukemia and as far as I could tell, anything else they could think of, day after day. So lots of uncertainty, fear of hospital, fear or diagnosis and fear of cancer there; and then down the line ...
* My **Dad**, _Gordon_, was diagnosed with widespread cancer at 52 in the 90s just as I was starting my PhD in Leicester. He was dead within a very difficult 5 months of miserable decline. The cancer was found very late, his fitness apparently compromising its detection. Tough on him, tough on us. Tough, tough, tough.

Anyhow, the Leicester dermatologists suspected that my mole was skin cancer, so they cut it off my calf and I recuperated with my leg up for a couple of weeks in the _Isles of Scilly_: "_no swimming_".
The histology confirmed a melanoma and while there is some good news in terms of its excision, with good margins, I have required more surgery to remove and rearrange more skin, and more tests and time to rest and recover, and as we learn more it looks like I'll need further treatment as we work out what's going on and where this is heading. I'm in the hands of the oncologists now and they seem to have a good programme of treatment to hand. #hopeful.

That’s the **Life Crash** really. Because it stops you suddenly, hits you with shock, hurts awfully, captures your focus and you just feel as though you have slipped into a parallel universe that you don’t want to be in and can never re-emerge from … which is where the skateboarding metaphor breaks down completely I suppose. Until you try to pick yourself up again and get back on the board and scoot forward. Cautiously. Slowly. Hopefully. And the consultant is very hopeful. They want to help me _Bounce Back_ and to focus on recovery.

It helps me to think this way, to write this way and use the notion of **Life Crash** to briefly frame all that is going on. And explain, and share.

In jotting this down, I wonder why people seem so frequently, so predictably, to write about and broadcast this kind of stuff? I think it is about control. Framing the thing that you don’t want to happen, the thing that threatens you, that scares you, that defines you in many ways, gives you a means of taming it a little … at least psychologically, at least temporarily.<br/> 
<!--- Hence my **Life Crash**.<br/> --->
_Making it physical_ helps me understand how to respond to it - as, believe me, the psychological side of things is significant, debilitating, dynamic and complex. And I am doing my best to work with the amazing scientists, doctors, surgeons, oncologists, psychotherapists and neuropsychiatrists to get back on my feet - physically and mentally, literally and figuratively: to _Bounce Back_.<br/>
_Cartoonifying the whole thing_, and even sharing some empathy with the poor dude who hit the bin in Barcelona, helps a bit too.<br/>There’s not much more in life than love and laughter. Well, pain and fear I guess too. There must be some kind of fundamental relationship there between those four.<br/>Maybe I can add in _hope_ as well now?

Also, it helps me focus on some of the positives. There are some really good potential outcomes, some promising signs, and excellent treatments are available and emerging, and I am putting all efforts into trying to do as well as my super-inspiring Mum, who at 82 has had half a century of fulfilling life post-treatment. But of course there are some grim places where this could go too and you can’t help thinking about those, assessing and addressing your mortality and feeling as though nothing will ever be quite the same. Maybe this is life threatening. Maybe it is life shortening. Maybe it is life limiting. Maybe it is life altering. Maybe not. Maybe I’ll fall off my bike next time I am out on the road or trip down the stairs in my new post-op baggy merino pyjamas and nobody will have to worry about any of this at all. But sunrises do seem a little sharper that they did right now. Cuddles with the kids are a little longer, a little more intense.

So, there you go - my framing. I’ve had a lot of fun in life - no complaints. We all die sometime, and every now and again it’s good to have a long hard think about this and what it means - even when you have a screen full of overdue emails. This **Life Crash** concept, thinking, art, sharing, has helped with that. I have gone deeper than ever before. It is a threat, and it hurts, but I am trying to get back on my feet and dust myself down … with a bit less skin on my leg, a few scars to show, a lot of amazing help (thanks everyone, golly gosh I'm lucky), and a bit more experience of ageing, mortality, and what all of this means for now and the future. For me, sure, but also for _Alma_, _Brook_, _Fred_ and _Nell_, and for _Emma_ too, for whom this is a right pain. And we move forward with hope. As the clinical neuropsychiatrist said just before prescribing me a box set of _Monty Python_ films: "_none of us get through life without a few bumps and scrapes do we?_"

In terms of [Henry Jones](https://www.juxtapoz.com/news/magazine/stay-loose-a-six-pack-with-henry-jones/)' cartoon, well I am pleased that I have managed to buy some _Grip Tape_ that features it ... and now have this framed and hung on the wall at home.
Thanks to [Concrete Wave in Köln](https://www.concretewave.de/) for sending it over - with loads of cool stickers too.<br/>
And I have managed to find a deck as well. There was only one anywhere online - at the [Southopia Skate Park in Ragusa, Sicily](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qVBoYxYmZAm3mbxw5). Thanks to _Google Translate_, which got me talking to the Sicilian skateboarders, and the [Southopia Shop](https://www.southopiashop.com/) who shipped it, and particularly to _Famiglia Tarroni_ for helping get it ordered, purchased, posted and squeezed through customs despite Brexit! Nice work everyone, appreciated.<br/>
I don't skate, but it's great to have the deck hanging at eye level as I try to get back on my feet.<br/>
Love, laughter, fear, hope, pain and purchases, right?!

‘**Life Crash**’!

And a lot of people helping me to _[Bounce Back](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bouncing-Partridge-Notebook-Journal-Hardcover/dp/B0BQWR2X2P/ref=sr_1_5)_.
