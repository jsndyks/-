## LIFE CRASH

---

When I was thinking about what has happened to me over the last few months, the term ‘**Life Crash**’ seemed to describe it pretty well.

I Googled it, and not much came up, other than [a wonderful  sequence of drawings](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceq4sHqOAvQ/?img_index=1) by [Henry Jones](https://henryjonesstudio.com/) that depicts [an incident caught on video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceq4sHqOAvQ/?img_index=4) outside the [MACBA in Barcelona](https://www.macba.cat/en). &laquo;CRASH!&raquo; I like the _sigh_ on the video too.

The sequences of sketches depicting &laquo;CRASH!&raquo; is part of a ‘_[MACBA Life](https://macbalife.com/)_’ collection that observes the everyday happening around the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art. That’s how _Life_ and _Crash_ find themselves together in a Google search. The term seemed to describe how I felt very effectively, but the incident and the way Henry Jones captured the crash resonated very strongly with me. 

Somehow the cartoon captures how I feel: joyful, painful, funny, surprising, uncertain, everyday, extraordinary. There I was, cruising along, decent pace, smooth surface, enjoying life without too much friction, pulling a few tricks, not working too hard but still surprising a few people(myself mainly), loving the view (the family, the bike, the kayak, even the cats) and the feeling of the breeze rushing by, good balance - slight adjustments, and thinking I knew how to ride this thing pretty well when … &laquo;CRASH!&raquo;. I’m on my back, looking at the skies, seeing stars and wondering whether or not I can pick myself up and keep going. My head hurts. Everything hurts. Everything has stopped. What the hell was that? What was I doing?

My sturdily foundationed litter bin is skin cancer. Early in the summer I noticed a mole on the back of my leg that I didn’t remember seeing before. My kayaking and swimming and cycling and beach pilgrimages were interrupted by various checks, photos, consultations and ultimately minor surgery. I got a call from the Dermatology unit while I was paddling on the River Fowey and had one final swim before being called home early and dragging the family back to Leicester. I sort-of knew where I was.

I know my moles well. I have always been fussy about my skin as my Mum, Phyl, had a malignant melanoma removed in the 70s when she was in her early 30s. I was about 10 then: blond bowl haircut, baggy jeans, M&S T-shirt. Despite her amazing and inspiring recovery, I have always been hyper vigilant and hyper scared of cancer as: Mum had a big chunk of her thigh removed; and, I spent many nights in hospital aged about 12 on a ward with kids who had cancer. The kids on the ward at Bristol Children’s Hospital had hairy wigs by day and seemed quite lively - they raced around the ward more than I did. But my memories of the nights are strong and stay with me. The kids were bald and restless, wailing and needing medical staff as the lights on their bedside machines flashed and beeped in the dark. It sounded awful. I remember the desperation of the doctors in the dark. I wasn’t sure whether people were dying or being kept alive. I didn’t sleep much. I had an undiagnosed muscle wasting disease, lots of blood taken, and doctors standing over me discussing cancer, leukemia and as far as I could tell, anything else they could think of day after day. So lots of uncertainty, fear of hospital, fear or diagnosis and fear of cancer there; and then my Dad got cancer at 52 in the 90s and was dead within a very difficult 5 months of miserable decline.

Anyhow, the Leicester Dermatologists suspected that my mole was skin cancer, so they took it off my leg and the histology confirmed a melanoma and while there is some good news in terms of its removal, with good margins, I need more surgery and tests and time to rest and recover. That’s the **Life Crash** really. Because it stops you suddenly, hits you with shock, hurts awfully and you just feel as though you have slipped into a parallel universe that you don’t want to be in and can never re-emerge from … which is where the metaphor breaks down completely I suppose. Until you try to pick yourself up again and get back on the board and scoot forward. Hopefully.

It helps me to think this way, to write this way and use the notion of **Life Crash!** to briefly frame all that is going on. And explain, and share.

In jotting this down, I wonder why people seem so frequently to write about and broadcast this kind of stuff, and I think it is about control. Framing the thing that you don’t want to happen, the thing that threatens you, that scares you, that defines you in many ways, is a way of taming it a little … at least psychologically. 
Hence my **Life Crash!** 
Making it physical helps me understand how to respond to it - as believe me, the psychological side of things is significant, debilitating and complex. And I am doing my best to work with the amazing scientists, doctors and psychotherapists to get back on my feet. Cartoonifying the whole thing, and even sharing some empathy with the poor dude who hit the bin in Barcelona helps a bit too. There’s not much more in life than love and laughter. Well, pain I guess too. There must be some kind of relationship there between those three.

Also, it helps me focus on some of the positives. There are some really good potential outcomes, some promising signs, and excellent treatments are available and emerging, and I am putting all efforts into trying to do as well as my super-inspiring Mum, who at 85 has had half a century of fulfilling life post-treatment. But of course there are some grim places where this could go too and you can’t help thinking about those, assessing and addressing your mortality and feeling as though nothing will ever be quite the same. Maybe this is life threatening. Maybe it is life shortening. Maybe not. Maybe I’ll fall off my bike at the weekend or trip down the stairs in my new post-op baggy pyjamas and nobody will have to worry about any of this at all. But sunrises do seem a little sharper that they did right now.

So, there you go - my framing. I’ve had a lot of fun in life - no complaints. We all die sometime, and occasionally it’s good to have a long hard think about this and what it means. This **Life Crash** has helped with that. I have gone deeper than ever before. It is a threat, and it hurts, but I am trying to get back on my feet and dust myself down … with a bit less skin on my leg, a few scars to show, a lot of amazing help (thanks everyone), and a bit more experience of ageing, mortality, and what all of this means for now and the future.

I am pleased that I have managed to buy some _Grip Tape_ with Henry Jones' cartoon on ... and am trying to find the deck.<br/>
Love, laughter, pain and purchases, right?!
